Project Description

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for estimating the prices of used cars in Saudi Arabia. The project encompasses various stages, starting with understanding the business problem, followed by exploring and understanding the data. Next, data cleaning will be performed to ensure the dataset's quality and consistency. Data analysis will unveil valuable insights from the dataset, guiding the feature engineering process.

Feature engineering involves transforming and selecting relevant features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. After this stage, the modeling process commences, where machine learning algorithms are employed to develop the predictive model. The final stage encompasses drawing conclusions from the model's predictions and offering actionable recommendations to stakeholders, providing them with valuable insights as a skilled Data Scientist.
